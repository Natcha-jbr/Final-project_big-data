What Makes a Game Perform?
# Project Description
Analyzing the Impact of Price, Language Support, and Violence on Game Success
# Getting Started
This project investigates how key features of PC games—price, language availability, and violence level—affect their performance on Steam, the world's largest digital distribution platform for PC games. We combine multiple public datasets, engineer relevant features, and apply regression to answer:
How do price, language support, and violence content influence user reception and player engagement?
Our findings aim to inform game developers, publishers, and industry analysts about which factors most strongly drive a game's success.
